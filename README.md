Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) are mainly those unprotected by an outside shield, namely pedestrians and two-wheelers, as they sustain a greater risk of injury in any collision against a vehicle and are therefore highly in need of protection against such collisions. 

## Motivation:
About 2-3 pedestrians or bicyclists are involved in fatal crashes at signalized intersection per day (NHTSA)
Pedestrian phases are designed based on geometric design at intersection and an assumed walking speed
Certain VRUs are severely disadvantaged at crosswalks and intersections because they may have difficulty completing the crossing within the pre-programmed pedestrian phases
How can we account for different types of pedestrians?
How can we accommodate different walking speeds in pedestrian phases?
